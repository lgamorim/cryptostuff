# cryptostuff

A cryptocurrency market data application: a core layer that owns the domain
workflow, an isolated CoinGecko API client beneath it, and two presentation
hosts above it — a console app and a minimal REST API. See
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the full plan of record.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK `10.0.301`, pinned in [`global.json`](global.json).
- A CoinGecko demo API key. Locally, set it as a user secret under
  `CoinGecko:ApiKey`; in deployment, set the `CoinGecko__ApiKey` environment
  variable.

## Build, test, and format

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet format
```

These have nothing to act on until `cryptostuff.slnx` and its projects land in
Milestone 1.2.
